# Bio:

My name is Landon McPhee, and I am an Interactive Arts and Science Major at Brock University finishing my second year of study. Within the digital humanities I wish to study the reason for virtual interaction amongst people, through data visualization. Interpretive data sets, wherein we view digital user data through online social platforms, we can then interpret reason, cause, and how to replicate certain kinds of interactions. This kind of research can help shape the digital landscape towards good online interaction, that develops online communities in a healthy capacity. Throughout my academic blog, I highlight the different reasons people would wish to use interpretive data sets, and through my revisions to that Blog, you may see how I have directed it’s information to point towards its uses in the digital humanities in studying people, and their interaction, both with digital platforms, and people through digital platforms. People can not be defined simply by traditional linear data sets, and instead act in irregular patterns that change as people change, therefor a gap where interpretive data sets can assume a person's pattern before it happens based on past collected data and research on patterns. I hope that this research will help sculptors of the digital landscape and online interaction, shape it to be preferable for all people.

Throughout my academic blog post, I go through the reasons for using interpretive data sets as a form of not only pushing the field of digital humanities forward but also bringing digital humanities closer to it’s more traditional humanities roots. The digital humanities in its current state is filled with external data sets and research, which really does it no favours, as the entire field is based around people and the understand of qualitative data. To this end data sets, and research done to gather qualitative data is the most valuable form of research in our field, and should be held to that regard. My reason for looking into this topic, was my personal connection with data and information. On my own I find that the value of qualitative data, is not seen in the regard that it should, real answers with insight are some of the most valuable data we can gather, and whilst it might not always be the easiest data to put into use, it can make the most valuable changes to any given form of media.My research into this topic was doing close readings of Drucker, Ramsay, and Moretti, as well as looking to a few outside sources on the topic such as the article from Tanya. E. Through these articles I found commonality amongst terms and topics discussed such as the value of qualitative data and informal data sets. To this end I looked for these portions of these articles and used the information as background for my thesis.

## Revisions:

My research and Academic Blog changed over time as I received feedback from my instructor Alexander Christie, he commented that something I did right with my Blog, was dividing the topics into subdivisions. After adding some finer thoughts and elaborating based on feedback that stated that I didn’t delve deep enough in some sections. To this extent I decided to elaborate on some of my own thoughts and research towards the value of qualitative data, to help try to prove the finer points in my thesis of it’s value in the digital humanities. After I added these finer points which were changed in this “[commit](https://github.com/LandonAM/ISAC-2P02/commit/59f582b8d85efd8cdff464aa0a5c438cdba1e1b4)”, I then subdivided my work into smaller sections in some places, as well as giving my own new revision a division of its own to define my thoughts as their own section. I placed it in a spot within my Academic Blog that seemed to fit it best, and the reason my added thoughts pertain to modern media much more than previous research towards the blog, was that I have found new value in modern mass media such as Twitch and Youtube, and how valuable research into the trends of audience and viewers can help to discover new information around how people interact on digital and online platforms. The last two commits I would like to refer two are of smaller importance, but are the divisions I made to the research to make the post more readable, “[here](https://github.com/LandonAM/ISAC-2P02/commit/8c5e869ed333657ca9556748d5e11a29ef2d3cfc)” and “[here](https://github.com/LandonAM/ISAC-2P02/commit/ae5eb2b23a7c5c46269c0afbb06202f46ebe6dae)”.

# Collaberative Project

For my collaborative project, we took a look at the [Archives Unleashed Cloud](https://archivesunleashed.org/cloud/) which is a cloud archive where information based on websites visited, and their respective connections to other websites are tracked and stored in an archive. This is used to graph interpretive data sets, as well as simply gather original data based on those who use the service. It is a paid service that we were not able to get access to, but we were able to use some of the lesser parts of service to try to track data of our own. We worked in a group of three to find information.

Throughout the project we were separated by distance considering we could not all meet up at Brock at the same time often, to this end we created a server on a service called discord where we could collaborate freely on the project. Using the system out instructor put in place, where before the due date of the assignment, we not only had to close issues for ourselves submitting our work, but once all members had closed their issues, we also had to do a final close on the group’s issue. This made it simple to track members progress, and see how much work still needed to be done at different stages. Working with others was a great way to see the thoughts others crafted while they researched the tool, and the different ideas that came to rise from the discussion geared our presentation towards a different path that it would have otherwise. We did most of our work in large chucks, submitting it all in one, then making minor changes as we needed to. This ensured work got done, and that by the end, we did in fact have the project done for our final due date. Once I had uploaded all my assets for the presentation, I closed the issue [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/issues/14) Once we finished the assignment I closed out group’s issue as a final statement [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/issues/26) Finally this was the [commit where I submitted most of my final work before editing.](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/commit/f21844c13ca13b8d34c38d4e6c999f2478ec1b3a)
