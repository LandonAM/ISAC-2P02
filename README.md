# Bio:

My name is Landon McPhee, and I am an Interactive Arts and Science Major at Brock University finishing my second year of study. Within the digital humanities I wish to study the reason for virtual interaction amongst people. Interpretive data sets, wherein we view digital user data through online social platforms, we can then interpret reason, cause, and how to replicate certain kinds of interactions. This kind of research can help shape the digital landscape towards good online interaction, that develops online communities in a healthy capacity. Throughout my academic blog, I highlight the different reasons people would wish to use interpretive data sets, and through my revisions to that Blog, you may see how I have directed itâ€™s information to point towards its uses in the digital humanities in studying people, and their interaction, both with digital platforms, and people through digital platforms. People can not be defined simply by traditional linear data sets, and instead act in irregular patterns that change as people change, therefor a gap where interpretive data sets can assume a person's pattern before it happens based on past collected data and research on patterns. I hope that this research will help sculptors of the digital landscape and online interaction, shape it to be preferable for all people.
