# About Me:

  Hello, my name is Landon McPhee and this is my GitHub repository for IASC 2P02.
  
  I am a prospective developer of games, I admire the introspective look into the effect games have on people and communities both online and offline, and I hope to one day develop stories for games that will inspire and amaze audiences of all kinds.

Here is a link to my Blog post on Interpretive data sets created by and for the digital humanities.
